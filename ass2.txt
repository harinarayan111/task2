task1:

                     HTTP/1.1
        *It works on the textual format
        *There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesn’t get its all resources
        *It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
        *It compresses data by itself


                     HTTP/2
          *It works on the binary protocol
          *It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests
          *It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
          *It uses HPACK for data compression



task2:

    
                   object:
                                  An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property’s value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.
  

                   js object:
                                      A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. We can access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:

[objectName.propertyName]
